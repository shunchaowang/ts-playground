<h2>Sliding Window</h2>
This algorithmic technique is used when we need to handle the input data in specific window size.
<h2>Two Pointers</h2>
In this technique, we use two pointers to iterate the input data. Generally, both pointers move in the opposite direction at a constant interval.
<h2>Fast & Slow Pointers</h2>
Also known as Hare & Tortoise algorithm. In this technique, we use two pointers that traverse the input data at a different speed.
<h2>Merge Intervals</h2>
This technique is used to deal with overlapping intervals. Given two intervals (‘a’ and ‘b’), there will be six different ways the two intervals can relate to each other. I've mastered this technique when I solved interval 
meter reading for AEP with peakload.
